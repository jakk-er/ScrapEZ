**ScrapEZ Documentation**
==========================

**Overview**
-----------

ScrapEZ is a web scraping tool that allows you to extract links and data from a website. The tool provides four scraping methods: **scraping subdomain links**, **scraping pages links**, **scraping robots.txt**, and **scraping embedded links**.

**How it Works**
---------------

ScrapEZ uses the **requests** and **beautifulsoup4** libraries to send HTTP requests to the target website and parse the HTML responses. The tool then extracts the desired data based on the chosen scraping method.

**Scraping Methods**
-------------------

### 1. **Scrape Subdomain Links**

This method extracts all subdomain links from the target website. The output will include a list of URLs in the format `subdomain.example.com`.

### 2. **Scrape Pages Links**

This method extracts all page links from the target website. The output will include a list of URLs in the format `example.com/page`.

### 3. **Scrape Robots.txt**

This method extracts the contents of the target website's `robots.txt` file. The output will include the raw contents of the file.

### 4. **Scrape Embedded Links**

This method extracts all embedded links (e.g., images, scripts, stylesheets) from the target website. The output will include a list of URLs in the format `example.com/resource`.

**Configuration Options**
-------------------------

Currently, there are no configuration options available for ScrapEZ. However, you can modify the script to customize the scraping behavior or add new features.

**Troubleshooting Tips**
-------------------------

### **Common Issues**

* **Timeout Errors**: If you encounter timeout errors, try increasing the timeout value in the script or checking your internet connection.
* **HTML Parsing Errors**: If you encounter HTML parsing errors, try updating the **beautifulsoup4** library or checking the website's HTML structure.

### **Debugging**

To debug the script, you can add print statements or use a Python debugger like **pdb** to step through the code.

**Customization Possibilities**
-----------------------------

You can modify the script to:

* **Add new scraping methods**
* **Customize the output format**
* **Integrate with other tools or services**
* **Improve performance or efficiency**
